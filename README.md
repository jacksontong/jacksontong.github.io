## Local Development

### Quick Setup with VSCode DevContainer

1. Open the project in VSCode.
2. Install the ["Remote - Containers"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension if you haven't already.
3. When prompted, select "Reopen in Container".
4. Wait for the container to build and start.

### Start the Server

To start the server with hot reloading, run:

```sh
make serve-dev
```
